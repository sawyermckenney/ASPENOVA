## Style Guidelines:

- Primary color: Soft gray (#B0B0B0) to bring a sense of neutrality and sophistication, harmonizing well with the minimalist approach. The concept that informs the choice here is cleanliness.
- Background color: Off-white (#F5F5F5), providing a light backdrop that enhances readability and visual clarity in line with minimalism. It is noticeably similar to the primary hue but desaturated for the background, thus unifying the experience and contributing to the desired sleek style.
- Accent color: Charcoal gray (#333333) used for key interactive elements like buttons and headings, offering a stark contrast against the lighter backdrop to focus user attention, while staying true to the monochromatic palette.
- Use modern, sans-serif fonts for headings and body text to maintain a clean and minimalist aesthetic.
- Employ a grid-based layout system to ensure consistent spacing and alignment of content across all pages.
- Incorporate subtle transition animations to enhance the user experience without being distracting.
